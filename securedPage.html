                based on the E30 3 Series, but it had many modifications to make it faster, lighter and more
                aerodynamic. It had a 2.3-litre four-cylinder engine with four valves per cylinder, producing up to 238
                hp. It was built to compete in the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft and Group A Touring, and it won
                many championships and races around the world. The BMW M3 E30 is a rare and iconic car that is loved by
                enthusiasts and collectors alike. It is the ultimate expression of the M philosophy: The most powerful
                letter in the world.</p>
